Project 10 - class state and bootstrap

class A {

 name, surname, age;

}

class B extends React.Component{

    //1. Property Area

    // it is not a right approch to initilize the property instead this we will use
    // constructor
    name=' ';
    surname = ' ';
    age = ' ';

     // it is inbuild javascript object
     state = { 

      }

    //2. Constructor Area
            //it is special method and it is used to initialize the properties

         this.state = {
			
         }

    //3. method
    

}
